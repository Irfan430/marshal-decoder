## Overview

XPRO NEXUS DECODER is a **professional-grade Python marshal decoding framework**
designed for reverse engineering, malware analysis, and recovery of
obfuscated Python scripts.

This MASTER EDITION is optimized for:
- High power decoding
- Zero-crash execution

- AI-assisted reconstruction

---

## Key Capabilities

- Decode Python files encrypted using `marshal.dumps`
- Automatic detection and extraction of embedded bytecode
- Multi-path decode engine with intelligent fallback
- AI-assisted reconstruction from Python bytecode
- Works even on heavily obfuscated scripts
- Minimal output: only the decoded file you need

## Output Behavior

The decoder generates **only one file**:

```
<original_filename>_DECODED.py
```

Saved automatically to:

```
~/Downloads
```

No temporary files. No clutter.

---

## Usage

```bash
python3 xpro_decoder.py
```

Then provide the path to the encrypted Python file when prompted.
